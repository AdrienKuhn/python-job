## Usage

### Docker images

Multi-arch docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/krewh/python-job):

* The `latest` tag is built from the main branch.  
* The `latest` tag and the last release tag are refreshed nightly to get the latest security updates.

```bash
docker run --rm python-job
```
